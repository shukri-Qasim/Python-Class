#Styles of writing in python
"""
1.Structured programming is a programmming paradigm aimed at improving clarity, quality and development time.
it involve solving problems dtep by step using a topdown approach .
CHARACTERISTICS:
A->Top-down approach:breaking down the problem into smaller manageable pieces.
B->Focus On procedure: writing a function and procedures to perform specific tasks.
Example
Writing a function to calculate the sum of numbers.


2.Object Oriented programming(OOP):
this is a programming paradigm that uses object to design software.
it is based on the concept of real world entities . 
CHARACTERISTICS:
A->classes and objects:central to Oop where a class is blue print and object is instance of a class.
Example
Designing a program based on real world objects,like car, animal or students.
B-> a blueprint is a master copy(class)  of an object where as an obeject is a duplicate of the original thing(class)
therefore an object is belongs to a class .
Classes are written in singular for example  class Student.
C->Classes give us charecteritics of objects.
D-> If you want to identify class of an object we use "is a"

KEY CONCEPTS
1.Abstraction: this is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts i.e this is the level of representation .
it helps in identify the essential charecteristics of an object.
2.Inheritance:this is a mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class ,it promotes code reusibility.
3.Polymorphism: this allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class .
It means many forms.
4.Encapsulation: this is the bundling of data(attributes) and methods(function) that operates on the data into a single unit of class.
it also restricts direct access of the some objects components.
5.Overloading:this allows multiple methods inthe same class to have same name but different parameters.
6.Overriding: this occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by it is class.
in other words the subclass replaces the inherited method by it is own implementation.
